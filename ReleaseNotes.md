## Version 1.99.0

Release 1.99.0 is a _beta_ release of the forthcoming Release 2.0 of JournalViewer (ergo "JournalViewer 2"), and intended to replace the old JournalViewer code ("JournalViewer 1").

There is much functionality still to introduce into this version - most work to date has been focussed on creating a code flexible enough to handle the broad changes underway on IDAaaS. There will be bugs, there will be absent features that you dearly miss, and there will be stuff that probably doesn't work at all / as expected.

Constructive feedback via the [JV2 Issues page](https://github.com/disorderedmaterials/jv2/issues) on GitHub is welcomed.
