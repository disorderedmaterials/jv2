The availability of basic run information collected on a given ISIS instrument is  a basic requirement for an operational beamline. Metadata for each individual run is captured automatically by the underlying system and stored in 'journal' files - XML-formatted files which are local to each instrument. The data contained therein is viewable through the "Journal Viewer" page within the instrument control software (IBEX), providing information such as run number, run title, and user information.

**JV2** is a standalone desktop application designed for use outside of IBEX, and which aims to provide better access to the information contained within the instrument journal files, adding additional functionality such as sorting, grouping and filtering of this data. Beyond this, it also allows interrogation of the run data itself, along with the associated log file containing instrument and sample environment data block values captured within IBEX, and provides graphing capabilities for this data.
