While local to each 'NDH' instrument computer, the journal files for every beamline are also mirrored to a network filestore location (http://data.isis.rl.ac.uk/journals). It is these files that **JV2** reads from the network, parses, and displays, as its primary function. This means that, while on the local network (potentially via VPN) every stored journal file for every beamline is available within **JV2** from any computer. Moreover, if the location of the ISIS data archive is set, **JV2** will also be able to plot block value data from any run file detailed within the journal. **JV2** can be configured to read from local sources, meaning basic run information can be viewed even when off-site (without VPN) or offline when files are available.

**JV2** is also able to traverse through directories of run data (i.e. `log`, and/or `nxs` files) stored on a local machine, permitting block value interrogation to be performed offline as well. This is of particular use to external users who wish to use the software to process / view the run data associated with their experiments.
