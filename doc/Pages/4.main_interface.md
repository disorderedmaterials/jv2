The main window displays the contents of the current instrument / journal target, and allows filtering of this data through controls located at the top of the main table (Figure 1). A single journal file or, optionally, the complete history / a filtered subset of all available journal files available for a single instrument can be selected and viewed with the **Instrument** and **Cycle** controls (1).

## Main View

The main view (4) displays in tabular form the available run data in the current journal. Run data are, by default, listed in order of increasing run number, but the quantity by which visible data are sorted can be changed by clicking on the header for the relevant column. The visible columns can be adjusted through the View menu. These columns can be resized and reordered by clicking and dragging the headers.

## Filtering

The **Filter** group (2) at the top of the main window allows limits on the visible run data for the current instrument/journal selection to be tailored to suit - by default all runs from the current journal target(s) are shown. Run data may be filtered by strings (and modified with additional symbols (¬,v,^))

Filtering is performed upon key-press, giving rapid and responsive results.


## Grouping

Instead of sorting runs by one of the displayed quantities, runs possessing the same title may be listed together in a single row by enabling grouping (**Tools&#8594;Enable Grouping**, or **Ctrl-G**). Selecting the option a second time will disable grouping and revert to the previous sort order. This feature facilitates simplified transfer of associated measurement data into data reduction and processing packages. It allows the user to see all the runs and the total run time of all entries sharing a title. It also provides the means to easily plot all runs in said group.

## Item Selection

Left-clicking an item or range of items selects them for further action. Right-clicking on a selection brings up a context menu with additional options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Plot from “ “Log** | Provides a sub-menu to select a parameter to plot selected runs against |
| **Select runs with same title** | Selects all runs with the same Title as the clicked item |
| **Plot detector spectrum** | Provides option to select detector to plot against |
| **Plot monitor spectrum** | Provides option to select monitor to plot against |

A quick text search of the visible run data can be made through **Tools&#8594;Find** (or pressing **Ctrl-F**), and allows the user to cycle through successive matches of the search string in both forward and reverse order aswell as selecting all matches (**F3**, **Shift-F3** and **Ctrl-F3** respectively.) Information regarding the search is shown in the status area (3).

## Mass Searches

The user can fill the table with a subset of data from across all journal files by using the mass search options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Search across cycles** | Provides a sub-menu to select a parameter to filter by, certain data headings and value ranges are provided options |
| **Select runs with same title** | Selects all runs with the same Title as the clicked item |
| **Go to specific value** |The application will select and open the journal file containing the given run number and select the run for the user.|

All mass searches are cached into the cycle changing button allowing for quick changes between different filtered views and reducing redundant processing. The **Clear cached searches** option clears these from the cycle list.
