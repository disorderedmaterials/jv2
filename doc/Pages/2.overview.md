**JV2** is written predominantly in C++, using the Qt toolkit for user interface elements and functionality, and python for network and data interfacing. Reading of instrument `journal` files is performed in a python backend to allow for easy insertion into the codebase and to contain data parsing. Reading of `nxs` files is achieved through the h5py library, using custom structures to allow for easy and consistent data integration into the GUI.

**JV2** makes use of various third-party libraries, namely [Qt6](http://www.qt.io) and python libraries h5py, lxml and flask.
