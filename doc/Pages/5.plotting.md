The Run Data Window (accessed via the selection context menu) allows interrogation of the data contained within the `log` and `nxs` files associated with each experimental run. This data essentially encompasses all block values defined in the current IBEX session, written at frequencies defined on a per-value basis, and can include beamline information such as jaw settings, ISIS status variables such as the current being delivered to the target stations, and any values being read out from sample environment equipment currently installed. **JV2** allows all this information to be quickly and easily plotted as a function of time, and across multiple runs. (figure 1)
The various values received by the instrument monitors and detectors can also be investigated in a similar manner (figure 2)

## **IBEX / Run Logs**

The generated tab is named after the selected field, hovering over this tab displays relevant further data about the plot.

The main graphing area (3) on the tab displays the currently-selected data - datasets from individual runs are drawn in different colours, additional fields may be added with the add field button (2). Several options (1) affect how the data is plotted. A log graph has:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Plot relative to run start times** | If un-ticked (default) then the x-axis on the graph will use date/time values as markers, typically giving a continuous plot of the run property as a function of time. If ticked then the data for each run will be plotted against hours, minutes and seconds relative to the starting time of each data collection period (i.e. when the BEGIN command was issued within IBEX). As such, negative time indicates IBEX log values that were collected before the BEGIN command. |
| **Add field** | As described this option allows users to add additional parameters to the graph to further compare different log areas.|

A detector graph has:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Per μs** |Toggles normalisation of data against μs|
| **Per μAh** |Toggles normalisation of data against μAh|
| **Divide by run** |Toggles normalisation of data against matching detector data from the given run|
| **Divide by monitor** |Toggles normalisation of data against matching detector data from the given monitor|


| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|

| Left-Click-Drag | Allows a portion of the graph to be zoomed in to, as defined by the rectangle drawn by the mouse. Holding the control key inverts the axis being zoomed. |
| Middle-Click-Drag | Slides the visible area of the graph with the mouse. |
| Right-Click |Expand the limits of the graph on X and Y to encompass all of the data currently being displayed. |
| Mouse-wheel scroll | Zooms in or out on the graph without changing the scale of the x and y axes. Uses current mouse position as the centre of the zoom.  |
| Arrow keys| Slides the visible area of the graph corresponding to the pressed key|
